# What's New

## Faster Downloads Tab - Images Load Instantly! ðŸš€

The Downloads Tab now loads game images at lightning speed.

### What You'll Notice

**Before:** Scrolling through your downloads was slow. Every game image had to download from Steam servers every single time.

**Now:** Images appear instantly! Once downloaded, they're saved locally and reused.

### What This Means For You

âœ… **Instant Loading** - Game headers pop up immediately when scrolling
âœ… **Save Bandwidth** - No more downloading the same image over and over
âœ… **Always Up-to-Date** - When Steam updates a game's artwork, we automatically grab the new version
âœ… **Smarter System** - We remember which games don't have images and stop trying to download them

### Where Are Images Stored?

All game images are saved to your `data/cached-img` folder. You can safely delete this folder anytime to clear the cache.

## Under The Hood (For The Curious)

We cleaned up some old code that wasn't being used anymore. Your app is now a tiny bit lighter and easier to maintain.

## Bottom Line

**Your Downloads Tab is now faster and more efficient.** That's it. Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
