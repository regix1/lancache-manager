# Lancache Manager v1.7.5

## What's New

### New Community Theme

Added a new theme:

- **Timber & Stone** - Warm browns and charcoals. Easy on the eyes for those late night sessions.

Also gave **Sage & Wood** a refresh - looks cleaner now.

Both have custom scrollbars and hover effects that actually match.

### Compact View for Downloads

New compact view so you can see more downloads without scrolling forever. Also improved sorting across downloads and management tabs.

### First-Time Setup Fixes

The setup wizard was a bit rough around the edges. Fixed a bunch of issues with Steam PICS auth, historical data import, and general flow. Should be much smoother for new users now.

### Theme System Improvements

Cleaned up theme consistency across the app. Notifications look better, scrollbars match your theme, buttons are more polished. If you've made custom themes they should look better too.

## Bug Fixes

- Modal display glitches fixed
- Sorting issues in Downloads and Management tabs
- Notification styling tweaks
- Button hover states

## Under the Hood

Big code cleanup. You won't notice anything but it'll make my life easier for future updates.
